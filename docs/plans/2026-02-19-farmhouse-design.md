# Modern Rustic Farmhouse: "The Clearing"

## Design Document

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Project:** Portfolio-grade modern rustic farmhouse
**Strategy:** Courtyard compound (Strategy A -- "The Clearing")

---

## 1. Design Brief

### Site Context
- **Setting:** Wooded estate, 5+ acres, mature tree cover (Douglas fir, western red cedar)
- **Climate:** Pacific Northwest -- mild, wet, diffuse grey light, rain as constant presence
- **Orientation:** Dense forest canopy to north/east; break in canopy to west/south revealing distant landscape view (mountain, valley, or water)
- **Arrival:** From east through forest, gravel drive curving through trees

### Program Requirements
- **Total area:** 4,500--6,000 SF (target ~4,900 SF built + 900 SF barn/garage)
- **Bedrooms/baths:** 4 bed / 4 bath + independent guest quarters
- **Special spaces:** Double-height great room, studio, wine cellar, library, outdoor living room
- **Garage:** Detached barn/garage with studio loft

### Aesthetic Parameters
- **Rustic-modern scale:** 5--6 (true hybrid, neither reading dominates)
- **Material palette:** Charred wood (shou sugi ban), board-formed concrete, weathering steel (corten)
- **Roof typology:** Intersecting gables
- **Composition:** Asymmetric / picturesque (accumulated, not composed)

### Portfolio Goals
- **Stance:** Atmospheric + experiential ("I design experiences, not objects")
- **Signature move:** Dramatic interior light -- clerestories, light slots, glazed gable ends washing concrete walls with shifting daylight

## 2. Concept Statement

The courtyard is not a patio. It is a constructed clearing -- a room without a roof that mirrors the natural clearing in the forest where the distant view opens. The compound creates two clearings: the landscape clearing (nature's) and the courtyard clearing (architecture's). The house exists at the threshold between them.

Three dark, gabled volumes are arranged like stones dropped into the site -- each landed according to its own logic (orientation, grade, program) but collectively defining an outdoor room that opens west/south toward the view. The courtyard's open edge is not a gap. It is the most important wall in the project -- a wall made of landscape and sky.

Arrival is through dense forest, along a gravel drive that reveals the compound incrementally: first the barn, then a stone wall, then the main house emerging between tree trunks. The buildings don't face a road -- they face each other and the sky. Every major interior space is calibrated to capture, filter, or amplify light from the western clearing. The intersecting gable roofs create a roofscape of dark peaks echoing the surrounding fir canopy, while clerestories at each gable intersection become light instruments -- washing board-formed concrete walls with shifting PNW daylight.

This is not a farmhouse that happens to be modern. It is a contemporary meditation on shelter, darkness, and the control of light, built in the language of agricultural form.

## 3. Compound Layout

### 3.1 Main House -- East/Southeast Side of Courtyard

**Form:** Two intersecting gables
- Primary gable: east-west, 64' x 30'
- Secondary gable: north-south, 28' x 24', branching from east end
- Two stories, ~3,200 SF

**Ground Floor:**
- Entry vestibule (east, from arrival drive) -- 7'-6" ceiling, board-formed concrete walls, basalt stone floor
- Library (east wing, north-south gable) -- 9'-0" ceiling, Douglas fir shelving against concrete walls
- Kitchen/dining (center of east-west bar) -- 9'-6" ceiling, exposed glulam ridge beam
- Double-height great room (west terminus) -- 22'-0" at ridge, full-height glazed gable (the Light Wall) facing into courtyard and through to distant view

**Upper Floor:**
- Primary suite over east half of bar -- 10'-6" at ridge, exposed rafters, horizontal slot window framing tree canopy
- Two secondary bedrooms in north-south wing upper level
- Interior balcony open to great room below

**Below Grade:**
- Wine cellar below north-south wing -- 7'-0" ceiling, stone walls, concrete vault, accessed by stone stair from library

### 3.2 Guest Pavilion -- North/Northwest Side of Courtyard

**Form:** Single gable, 40' x 20', single story, 800 SF
- Ridge runs east-west, parallel to main house but offset 8' west (picturesque stagger)

**Program:**
- Two guest bedrooms, each with full bath
- Shared entry vestibule
- South-facing wall (courtyard side): deep covered porch, 6' overhang, blackened steel posts
- North wall: mostly solid charred wood, dark and quiet face to forest

### 3.3 Barn/Garage -- Southeast, Flanking Arrival

**Form:** 1.5-story gable, 36' x 26', ~900 SF + loft
- Ridge runs north-south (perpendicular to main house)
- Rotated 10 degrees off main house grid, following curve of drive
- Reads as oldest building -- "the one that was here first"

**Ground Floor:** 2-car garage + workshop
**Loft:** Studio with north-facing clerestory at ridge peak

**Material differentiation:** Same shou sugi ban but heavier board profile -- wider planks, rougher texture

### 3.4 The Courtyard

- Usable zone: ~48' x 36', spatial volume extends to tree line
- Ground plane: basalt paving in irregular bond, deliberate gaps for moss and low fern colonization
- **Outdoor living room** (south half): freestanding board-formed concrete fire wall (8' tall, 12' wide), corten steel canopy extending 10' from main house, built-in concrete bench
- **Open west edge:** no structure, no fence. Paving dissolves into gravel, then moss, then forest floor. Distant view framed between main house gable end and guest pavilion corner
- **Single preserved/planted tree** off-center in courtyard (existing Douglas fir or specimen). The compound was built around this tree

### 3.5 Covered Connections

- **Breezeway** (main house to guest pavilion): corten steel and glass, 5' wide, single-slope lean-to roof, glass walls both sides. Walk through it as through a vitrine -- rain on glass above, courtyard on one side, forest on the other
- **No covered connection to barn.** 40' of gravel crossing from barn to house. The barn is independent

## 4. Section Logic

| Space | Ceiling Height | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Entry vestibule | 7'-6" | Compression. Low concrete ceiling, stone floor. Feel the weight of the house above. |
| Kitchen/dining | 9'-6" | Comfortable domestic scale under gable slope. Exposed glulam ridge beam. |
| Great room | 22'-0" at ridge | Full gable volume. The Light Wall rises the entire height. The release. |
| Library | 9'-0" | Intimate. Douglas fir shelving against concrete walls. |
| Primary suite | 10'-6" at ridge | Upper gable volume, exposed rafters. Horizontal slot window to canopy. |
| Guest rooms | 8'-6" | Simple, quiet, restful. |
| Studio loft (barn) | 12'-0" at ridge | Working volume. Raw. Concrete floor, exposed framing, north clerestory. |
| Wine cellar | 7'-0" | Below grade. Stone walls, concrete vault. Cooled by earth. No natural light. |
| Breezeway | 8'-0" | Lean-to slope. Transparent. |
| Outdoor living | Open / 9' at canopy edge | Corten canopy slopes from main house wall. Rain cascades off edge into stone runnel. |

## 5. Light Strategy

### 5.1 The Light Wall (Great Room)
West-facing glazed gable. Afternoon direct western light floods the great room and strikes the opposing board-formed concrete interior wall (east wall of great room volume). This wall becomes a sundial -- light pattern changes hourly, seasonally. On overcast PNW days, diffuse grey light fills the double-height space evenly, making Douglas fir structure glow.

### 5.2 Clerestory Seams
Where the north-south gable intersects the east-west bar, a 2' continuous clerestory ribbon runs along the junction. Brings zenithal light into stairwell and upper hallway -- spaces that would otherwise be dark interior zones.

### 5.3 Guest Pavilion South Porch
Deep overhang creates sharp shadow line on courtyard-facing wall. Morning light reflects off basalt courtyard paving and bounces up under overhang, creating soft uplight on charred wood soffit.

### 5.4 Barn Studio North Clerestory
Classic artist's studio lighting. Even, diffuse, north-sky light through a 3' continuous strip at barn ridge. No direct sun.

### 5.5 Wine Cellar -- Absence of Light
No natural light. Descend from library (warmly lit) through stone stair into complete darkness. Single low-voltage linear LED along concrete vault ceiling reveals bottles. Contrast makes both spaces more powerful.

### 5.6 Courtyard as Light Well
Roofless room capturing rain and light equally. Single courtyard tree filters light to outdoor living room -- dappled shade in summer, bare branches in winter admitting full grey sky.

## 6. Structural System

### Main House
- Glulam post-and-beam, 12' bay spacing along east-west bar
- Concrete shear walls at entry vestibule and great room east wall
- Steel ridge beam in great room (glulam at this span would be too deep)
- Concrete foundation walls form wine cellar

### Guest Pavilion
- Glulam post-and-beam, 10' bays
- Concrete pier foundation

### Barn
- Post-and-beam at 12' bays, heavier timber sections (8x8 posts vs 6x6 in house)
- Concrete slab on grade

### Breezeway
- Steel frame (HSS columns and beams), corten-clad
- Lightest structure in compound -- could be removed without affecting anything

## 7. Material Palette

| Material | Application | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Shou sugi ban cedar** | Primary exterior cladding, all volumes | Dark, matte, absorbs light. Reads as shadow against forest. Fire-resistant. Weathers to silver-black in PNW. |
| **Board-formed concrete** | Great room west wall, entry vestibule, wine cellar, foundation walls | Thermal mass for passive heating. Wood grain texture creates dialogue with timber frame. Anchors building to earth. |
| **Weathering steel (corten)** | Roof panels, canopy structures, outdoor fireplace surround, fascia details | Warm rust tone against dark wood and grey concrete. Changes with seasons. Standing-seam corten roof is the "fifth elevation" seen through trees. |
| **Douglas fir glulam** | Exposed interior structure -- beams, columns, ridge beams | Warm counterpoint to dark exterior. Interior surfaces glow gold in filtered light. Regional material. |
| **Basalt / dark granite** | Flooring at thresholds, outdoor paving, wine cellar floor | Connects interior to PNW ground plane. Thermal mass at grade. |
| **Blackened steel** | Window frames, connections, railings, hardware | Thin, precise lines against heavy materials. Industrial craft. |
| **Glass** | Large fixed panes at view terminus, operable clerestories, gable ends | The instrument of light. Fixed for view, operable for ventilation. |

## 8. Roof Geometry

- **Main house and guest pavilion gables:** 8:12 pitch (33.7 degrees). Steep enough to shed PNW rain and create dramatic interior volumes, shallow enough to avoid theatrical excess
- **Barn gable:** 10:12 pitch (39.8 degrees). Steeper, taller, more agricultural. Reinforces "older building" reading
- **Breezeway:** 2:12 pitch single slope. Minimal. Reads as infrastructure, not architecture
- **Cladding:** Standing-seam corten steel panels on all roofs
- **Overhangs:** 4'-0" at eaves, 2'-0" at gable rakes
- **Rain strategy:** Corten steel gutters exposed, not hidden. Water collected, channeled, released into stone-lined runnels feeding landscape

## 9. Signature Moves

1. **The Light Wall.** Full-height glazed west gable of the great room. Board-formed concrete wall opposite receives moving light all day. This wall is the project.

2. **Clerestory Seams.** Continuous clerestory ribbons at every gable intersection. Zenithal light articulates where separate volumes meet -- you read the compound from inside by the light between its parts.

3. **The Stone Threshold.** Basalt paving continues from exterior gravel court through front door into vestibule. No material break at the door. The floor doesn't know it's inside. Concrete walls flank at 7'-6" before erupting into the great room.

4. **The Rotated Barn.** 10 degrees off main grid, following the drive's curve. Reads as a building from a different era, built by a different hand. Makes the compound feel accumulated rather than designed.

5. **Rain as Material.** Deep 4' overhangs create dry zones where charred wood stays matte black. Beyond the overhang, surfaces weather differently. Exposed corten gutters and stone runnels make water visible and audible from every room.
